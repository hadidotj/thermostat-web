Thermostat Web Interface
========================

This is the web interface to control my homemade thermostat. It allows you to
see the current average temperature along with the temperature and humidity of
each room sensor. As of right now, you can turn the fan to Auto or On, and
change the system mode: Off, Heat, Cool.
